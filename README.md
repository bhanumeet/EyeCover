## Overview

EyeCover is an iOS application designed specifically for ophthalmologists and eye care professionals to capture standardized eye cover test photographs. The app automatically detects when an eye cover is removed and captures the image at the precise moment, ensuring consistent and reliable documentation of eye examinations.

## Features

- Real-time eye detection using custom trainer CoreML model
- Intelligent detection of one or both eyes
- Confidence-based filtering for accurate results

### üì∏ **Smart Capture System**
- **Automatic Capture**: Takes photo automatically when both eyes are detected after cover removal
- **Flash Control**: Toggle flash for optimal lighting conditions
- **Front/Back Camera Support**: Switch between cameras for different examination needs

### üëÅÔ∏è **Eye Cover Modes**
- **LC (Left Covered)**: For left eye cover tests
- **RC (Right Covered)**: For right eye cover tests
